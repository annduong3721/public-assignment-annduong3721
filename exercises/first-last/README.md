# Unit 2 Lesson 3 Problem Set

## Directions
### Short Response Section
Answer the questions in the `short-response.md` file using complete sentences and markdown syntax.

### Small Problems
* Formatted questions can be found in the `small-problems.md` file.
* Write your solutions in `answers.js`. Function delcarations have already been provided for you.
* To run your code, you may add a `<script>` tag to the `index.html` document and link your `answers.js` file.
* You may also run it in the terminal by running the `node answers.js` command from this directory.

#### Making the Test Pass
* The Unit Tests are located in `answers.test.js`. You can look inside that file. It's not magic. üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* In order for me to accept your PR, all of my tests must pass.
    1. Install the test with `npm install`. (Do this only one time)
    2. Run your test with `npm test`. (Run this command often to see if your functions are passing)

As always, when you are done, commit, push, and open a PR.
